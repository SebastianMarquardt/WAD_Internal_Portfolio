            <p class="text-left">"Never Gonna Give You Up" is a song recorded by British singer and songwriter Rick
                Astley, released
                as a single on 27 July 1987. It was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. The song was
                released as the first single from Astley's debut album, Whenever You Need Somebody (1987). The
                song was a worldwide number-one hit, initially in the singer's native United Kingdom in 1987,
                where it stayed at the top of the chart for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that
                year. It eventually topped the charts in 25 countries, including the United States and West
                Germany. The song won Best British Single at the 1988 Brit Awards. In 1990, Nick Lowe quoted from
                the song and called it "ghastly" in the lyrics to "All Men Are Liars", a song on his album Party
                of One. In 2004, "Never Gonna Give You Up" was voted number 28 in 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs...
                Ever by VH1. The music video for the song has become the basis for the "Rickrolling" Internet
                meme, leading the song to also be referred to as "The Rickroll Song". In 2008, Astley won the
                MTV Europe Music Award for Best Act Ever with the song, as a result of collective voting from
                thousands of people on the Internet, due to the popular phenomenon of Rickrolling. The song is
                considered Astley's signature song and it is often played at the end of his live concerts.</p>
